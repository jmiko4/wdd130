      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Let’s say you’re a photographer and you are looking for work; You need a website to display an attractive portfolio that showcases your best work for possible clients to view. This portfolio would also ideally have more information about you and how to contact you. My idea is to build a portfolio website for a photographer like me to showcase my best work and to attract more clients. This website will have a main page that leads to several different pages that showcase my different styles of photography and two additional pages that give more information about me and my contact information.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience of this website is possible clients interested in hiring me as a photographer or videographer. The audience may also be friends and family who want to see my images or work. The porfilio pages will display my best work for clients in a pleasing way.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>[About]</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Justin
        Your new best friend with a camera.

        Based out of Rexburg Idaho. 

        Photography has always fascinated me. I like trying to capture and communicate an emotion or experience through the art of Photography and Video. I started learning how to use a real camera making videos on my mission in Chicago. Since then I have been mastering the use of a camera to capture memorable pictures and videos.

        I am currently studying and based out of Rexburg Idaho where I am at BYU-Idaho. I also spend a lot of time in Utah and Northern California where my family lives. 

        I am excited for the chance to work with you and capture a special moment! Contact me for availability!
